Create a comprehensive Markdown-based mind map for the topic: `${topic}`

**Instructions:**
1.  **Goal:** Generate a detailed and thorough hierarchical outline of the specified topic. The aim is to capture the major sections and sub-sections comprehensively. Strive for a level of detail in the main sections (Level 2 headings) comparable to chapters in a comprehensive textbook or modules in a full course on the subject.
2.  **Format:**
    * Represent the hierarchy using Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.).
        * Level 1 (`#`) for the root topic: `${topic}`.
        * Level 2 (`##`) for **all significant main components or sections** of the topic. Be thorough at this level.
        * Level 3 (`###`) for sub-topics within main components.
        * Level 4 (`####`) and subsequent levels for further details, as needed.
    * After the text of each heading, append 1-3 relevant hashtags (e.g., `#keyword`, `#category`, `#concept`) separated by spaces.
    * **Optional Notes:** Immediately following any heading line (heading + hashtags), you can include one or more lines of plain text notes for further description or explanation. These notes should *not* start with `#`.
3.  **Structure Guidance:**
    * Start with `${topic}` as the Level 1 heading (`#`).
    * Critically analyze the topic to identify **all its major established subdivisions**. Think in terms of fundamental concepts, key areas, processes, applications, advanced topics, etc. List these as Level 2 (`##`) headings. **Do not stop at just a few; aim for a complete top-level breakdown.**
    * Under each Level 2 heading, break it down further into logical sub-topics (Level 3 `###`) and specific details (Level 4 `####`, etc.) as appropriate for that section.
4.  **Output:** Present the final result as a single Markdown structure.
