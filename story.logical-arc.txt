I want to write a compelling story with a strong logical arc. Help guide me through the process. Start by asking questions to clarify the genre, setting, main character, and central conflict. Then, help me outline the major story beats using a classic structure (like the Hero’s Journey or Three-Act Structure). As we progress, help me stay consistent with character motivations, world rules, and narrative logic. Also point out any potential plot holes, pacing issues, or underdeveloped elements as I write. Let’s build this step-by-step.
